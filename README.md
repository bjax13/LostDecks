# Lost Tales Marketplace

This repository contains an early prototype for a web application that
facilitates trading of Brandon Sanderson "Lost Tales" collectible story
cards. The project is still in the planning phase, but a simple
wireframe has been created to outline navigation and page structure.

## Getting Started

The `frontend` directory contains a static HTML prototype built with
React (loaded via CDN). Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser to
explore the wireframe. Internet access is required because the page
loads React and React Router from public CDNs.

See `docs/plan.md` for a high-level plan of the pages and features
considered for the minimum viable product.
